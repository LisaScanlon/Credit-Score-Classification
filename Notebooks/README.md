# Notebooks
 This is where all of the Jupyter Notebook files associated with this project will be stored. Right now there are 5 notebooks, labeled in chronological order. The main changes in this submission are that the data has been completely preprocessed, initial basic models have been created, and a final model has been chosen. The final model with parameter tuning is running super slow, so I need to still try to speed it up and hopefully continue to improve upon the accuracy.
