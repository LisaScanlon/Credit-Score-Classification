# Credit Score Classification

 Introduction: This is the repository for DS400 capstone project. This project will be called "Credit Score Classification", with the goal of allowing users (the target audience is the average consumer, as opposed to banks and other lenders) to use the final application to have a better idea of how a change in income, applying for other lines of credit, etc. will impact their credit score classification (Good, Standard, Poor). 

 Project Timeline: By Feburary 5th, a rough draft of the proposal will be outlined so that there is a clear path for completion. By Feburary 12th, all of the steps necessary for data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing will be completed. By Feburary 19th, I will have completed a basic model design, with more sophisticated models being completed by March 11th. Model implementation and training will be completed by the following week, followed by hyperparameter tuning and a basic model deisgn by April 1st. During the following week, I will have completed model evaluation and performance comparison with each of the models. By April 29th, all of the code should be completed and the final application should be functioning properly. 

 The poster presentation and final paper both go into detail as to how the idea was formed, what existing research on this topic exists, and what steps were taken to reach the desired outcome. Detailed explanations of the final application are also included throughout.
