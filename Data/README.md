# Data
 This is where the csv files containing the data for this project will be located. There is a Jupyter Notebook file that now contains (most of) the data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and preprocessing steps. Right now I am stuck with how to clean about 5 of the 27 columns. Almost all of them had to be cleaned in a unique way, so this was a challenging task.
